Maybe this essay should just be my personal experience of creating my mission...


## How to focus your giving

I recently had the opportunity to give away a good amount of my employer's money to charity. I was overhelmed with the causes to which I could give. I decided to come up with a personal charitable mission so that I could focus the money on one goal and make some perceptable progress towards that goal. In this post I will lay out how you too can become more focused in your giving. 

To focus your giving you will:

1. Develop a mission
2. Find charities that align with your mission
3. Give money to those charities

### Why focus your giving?

First of all, why would you want to do this? Well when you focus your giving on what you truly care most about you'll be more passionate and generous with your giving, you'll be more likely to get involved with your causes personally, and you'll know your dollars are well spent.

### Developing a mission

What is important to you? What causes do you already give to? What do you feel strongly about? Are there causes you have a personal connection to?

These questions will help you focus in on your mission. [Here are examples of 50 mission statements of non profits](https://topnonprofits.com/examples/nonprofit-mission-statements/).

Ok, think you have your mission statement? Now, try to focus it further. Do be afraid to get really specific. The more focused and specific your mission the easier it will be for you to have an impact in that area.
